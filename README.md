# UFOs

## Overview of Project

Dana is a data journalist who is at a point in her career where she has the freedom to choose the topics she wants to write about. When she's given the opportunity to write about her hometown McMinnville Oregon, she jumps on it for a couple of reasons. First, it's an opportunity to revisit the memories and people back home. And second, the topic UFOs. 

McMinnville is famous for its sightings and even has an annual gathering of UFO enthusiasta. It's a topic that Dana has been interested in since she was a child. When she first heard about farmer Trent's sighting back in 1950. The only thing she has to go on so far is a JavaScript file filled to the brim with sighting information. Countries, cities, states, type of sighting, there is a lot in this file. Thankfully, Dana is aware of JavaScript visual functionality. Her plan is to first use Javascript to display the data as a table. However, because there is so much data, sifting through it without any adjustments would be a challenge. Additionally, Dana wants to put everything together in a tidy HTML page. Her article, the table of data to support her findings, and easy to use filters to fine tune the results.

### Purpose

To provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.


## Summary
In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
